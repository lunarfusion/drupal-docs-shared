Design systems benefit from having a unique name. The name should not reference anything within the organizations brand guide, to ensure the design system is not confused with the brand or other tools.

## Examples

Adobe → "Spectrum"
eBay → "Playbook"
Skyscanner → "Backpack"
Google → "Material"
IBM → "Carbon"
Government of Canada → "Aurora"
REI → "Cedar"
Sainsbury's  → "Luna"
Trello → "Nachos"
