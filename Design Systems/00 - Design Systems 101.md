STATUS: WIP

A design system is a library of components which are used by developers to build the user interface of a website or piece of software. They streamline repetitive work, ensure design consistency, and facilitate governance of an organization's digital decisions.

❌  
A design system is not a brand. 

✅  
A design system is a tool created by developers and digital designers in order to facilitate their work. 

## Key features 

### Atomic
Some components are very simple and singular, such as a link or a button. We call those atoms.

Other components are more complex and can contain those smaller components, like an alert with a close button. We call those molecules.

As you create more complex components, such as those containing multiple molecules and atoms, you may decide to add an "organisms" category.
### Modularity
Components are created as separate parts that can be worked on individually. Working on the "carousel" component does not cause problems with the "accordion" component, because the front-end files for each component are separate. 
### Cross-compatible
Design systems should be usable by any application that needs to use it. If an organization uses multiple versions of a CMS or multiple front-end frameworks, they should still be able to use the CSS, JS, and structure recommendations that the design system provides.
